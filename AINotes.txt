AI Notes:

Behavior Trees:

- Make tasks as simple as we can.
- Build in stages
- Base abstract class is always Task
- Need to talk about what list type we will use
- Decide what the return type should be
- 

Types of Tasks:
	Condition:
		Returns true or false depending on the condition set with in it ( ex. enemy near )

	Action:
		Does an action ( ex. open door ) and returns true or false if succeeded

	Composite:
		A Task that hold, controls the order, and decide whether a task is run

		Sequencer ( -> ) & nondeterministic ( ~~> ):
			- Goes through all children until one fails or all succeed

		Selector( ? ) & nondeterministic ( ~? ):
			- Goes through all children until one passes

	Decorator:
		A task with a single child that is used to control the execution of that child.
